# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Text Encryption & Decryption Tool (with GUI)

A beginner-friendly *Python project* that demonstrates basic *text encryption and decryption* using the *Caesar Cipher* algorithm. Includes a simple, interactive *Tkinter GUI* for ease of use.

## 📌 Features

- 🔒 Encrypt or decrypt any message
- 🖼 GUI interface built with Tkinter (no command line needed)
- 🔁 User-defined shift value
- 🔤 Supports uppercase & lowercase letters
- ✳ Keeps non-alphabetic characters (e.g. symbols, spaces) unchanged

## 🧠 How Caesar Cipher Works

The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the text by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

*Example (Shift = 3):*

- A ➝ D
- B ➝ E
- X ➝ A
- Z ➝ C

To *decrypt, the letters are shifted in the **opposite direction*.
